## Phase 1

We aim to solve the Grab problem in [Microsoft Azure Virtual Hackathon](https://www.msazurevirtualhack.com/). The Grab challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/Feliren88/hakk.ai/blob/master/challenge%20guideline/Grab%20Challenge%20Guidelines%20-%20Phase%202.pdf)

Our team consists of:
1. Vicky Feliren
2. Firnas Aleem
3. Winson Wijaya
4. James Casia
5. Ivan Wijaya

Our video submission can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH37K8s8oEM).

Our initial mobile app prototype can be seen [here](https://github.com/Feliren88/hakk.ai/tree/master/picture/mobile%20apps)

### Evaluation
Refer to the [Challenge Guideline](https://github.com/Feliren88/hakk.ai/blob/master/challenge%20guideline/Grab%20Challenge%20Guidelines%20-%20Phase%202.pdf)

##### 1. Hidden datasets 
You can choose one of the following categories to test your model prediction accuracy. Please indicate your preference on the first page of your PPT. 
 
Singapore - Car - May 2019 - Sample Size 10000 
Jakarta - Car - May 2019 - Sample Size 10000 
Jakarta - Motorcycle - May 2019 - Sample Size 10000  
 
##### 2. Metrics RMSE is used as a metric to evaluate the error of prediction against actual travel time. A model with the lowest RMSE value is considered as the best-performing one. Here, we have given a RMSE baseline of each category for your reference. It will be great if your model can exceed the baseline.   

**Singapore - Car - _RMSE Baseline = 240_**
**Jakarta - Car - _RMSE Baseline = 320_**
**Jakarta - Motorcycle - _RMSE Baseline = 400_** 
 
##### 3. Implementations Besides prediction accuracy, _we will also evaluate your actual implementations including modeling, experiments, deployment, scalability, Azure architecture._
